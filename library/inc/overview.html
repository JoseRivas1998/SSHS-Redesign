    <div class="paragraph-title">Important End-of-the-Year Library Notice:</div>
    <p>The end of the year is quickly approaching. It will soon be time for students to return their library books,
        class novels, and textbooks. Students are receiving overdue/fine notices weekly. We encourage students to please
        take care of library obligations now, to avoid long lines at the end of the school year.</p><br/>

    <p>All Library books are due on or before Tuesday, May 28. If students have lost any books or incurred fines, they
        must pay with CASH ONLY; school district policy states that we cannot accept checks after<br/>May 10.</p><br/>

    <p>To receive yearbooks on time, students must clear all library obligations and previously incurred textbook
        obligations no later than 1:00 p.m. on Friday, May 30th.</p><br/>

    <p>Seniors must clear all library and textbook obligations and return all current textbooks by 1:00 on Thursday,
        June 6th, to participate in the graduation ceremony without any special clearance.</p><br/>

    <p>9th - 11th grade students must return their current textbooks by 1:00 on Wednesday, June 12th, to avoid
        potentially having their registration packet and locker assignment withheld for next year. There will be only 3
        days during the summer for students to take care of any library/textbook obligations after this date.</p>
