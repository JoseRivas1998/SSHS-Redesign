					Dear Troubadour Families,

					<p>
							As the holidays near, I extend my appreciation for your continued partnership, support, and parent leadership at Santa Susana High School. ​This holiday I am also especially thankful for your child's presence ​and school contributions ​every day.
					</p>

					<p>
							​When counting our blessings at Santa Susana, I ask you to join with me in praising our teachers who work ​tirelessly ​to provide an outstanding instructional program​ while tailoring educational initiatives to always provide the best for your child​. This year began with teacher analysis of student performance on the SBAC, grades, a-g eligibility, and Advanced Placement​, to name a few​. In classes, you ​will see students talking about their learning​, thinking at high levels,​ and frequently using technology to demonstrate ​their skills and learning! ​F​​ocused work ​such as this ​promotes student perseverance in the face of challenge​, ​while teachers ​are doing all they can to ensure every student​'s success is maximized.​​
					</p>

					<p>
							Campus creativity flourishes​ in this environment which can be seen in student activities ​such as:
					</p>

					<p>
							Mock Trial won 4th place ​overall and for two best witnesses ​in the ​International ​World Competition​ in New York​​!
					</p>

					<p>
							The performance season opened ​with the powerful Laramie Project. Aladdin/Treasure Island was enjoyed by those as young as 3 years old who laughed at actors​'​ silliness. Instrumental Music’s Star Wars and Peter and the Wolf (a senior project) included​ synchronized​ film, narration, dancing, and acting. Most recently, A Spoon Full of Sugar Vocal Music Concert was performed in four languages, with a beautiful Native American piece​,and plug for our ​upcoming ​Germany trip.
					</p>

					<p>
							At PTSA's Reflections Competition - "Let your Imagination Fly!", Santa Susana entered 14 of the 19 high school entries representing dance, film, literature, photography, and visual arts. Our students also won first place in most categories!
					</p>

					<p>
							​For Veteran's Day, ​Congressional Medal of Honor Recipient Sergeant Gary Littrell and Veteran Colonel Rob Pickel ​shared their stories with hundreds of students. So moved was one student, she give the pledge the next school day and will do so again in the future.
					</p>

					<p>
							​Look forward with me to Fall Ball, the junior class sponsored formal dance, which is certain to be a fun event. Additionally, December 11th,​ ​is ​our Career Education Arts, Media, &amp; Entertainment Demonstration Site Day. Demo Day allows us to teach other educators about our model programs, give student-led campus tours to incoming families, and to treat visitors to ​one of our amazing musicals, Once Upon A Mattress.
					</p>

					<p>
							In closing, ​our school, your ​family and​ ​our friends continues to be a vibrant and important part of student life at Santa Susana High School. Celebrate relaxing breaks, spending time and making memories with your child​. E​njoy​ ​the pleasurable moments of fading youth ​in the transition into young adulthood
					</p>

					<p>Sincerely,</p>

					<p>
