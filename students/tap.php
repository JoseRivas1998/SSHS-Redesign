                <h2>What is the 'Troubadour Advisory Program' (TAP)?</h3>
                    <p>
                        All Santa Susana High School students participate in the Troubadour Advisory Program (TAP), a
                        class which meets for 20 minutes on Wednesdays and Thursdays. TAP is unique to SSHS and supports
                        the school-wide goal to guide all students toward academic and personal success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        TAP is designed as a support system providing personalized academic guidance within the school's
                        structure of Schools and Academies. TAP advisement involves teacher advocates who regularly
                        monitor student academic progress as related to graduation requirements and preparation for
                        career and postsecondary education. Students meet in TAP twice weekly and remain with the same
                        TAP teacher for three of their four years of high school. During the senior year, students move
                        into “Troubadour Advanced Planning,” which groups students with mentors including the school
                        counselors and administrators, and prepares students for graduation and for the world beyond
                        high school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        TAP advisors follow a curriculum specific to grade-levels and curricular paths. Lessons require
                        students to complete regular self-reviews of academic progress. Quarterly student assignments
                        such as examining report cards provide an opportunity for TAP teachers to address the individual
                        needs of each student. Positive feedback is given for satisfactory grades, while encouragement
                        and suggestions for improvement are given for unsatisfactory performance. No student is
                        overlooked and all academic questions and concerns are confronted sooner rather than later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The TAP Program also lends to the supportive climate of Santa Susana High School. A time for
                        announcements to be broadcast and information to be distributed, TAP is an opportunity for
                        students to receive information pertinent to their academic coursework as well as their
                        extracurricular programs and activities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Santa Susana is dedicated to helping its students achieve. We know, however, that a team effort
                        is required, and we appreciate the support you give that allows us to work successfully with
                        your children. We cannot do it without you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We want to help students achieve, but we need their help. A passing grade in TAP can be earned
                        by simply arriving on time, participating in advisement activities and demonstrating respectful,
                        cooperative behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A passing Grade in TAP can be achieved through
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All school policies apply to TAP, just as in all other classes:

                        </li>
                        <li>The guidelines of each individual teacher must be followed</li>
                        <li>Each tardy will result in a one hour detention</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
