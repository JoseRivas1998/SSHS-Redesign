                <p>Dear students,</p>
                <p>Thank you very much for taking on the challenge of this class.   I hope you will find it informative and enjoyable.   For the class to have review time for the AP test we need to get started in the summer.   Please check out your book, American Pageant, in the library. You will find copies of the book online also. </p>
                <p>
                  Read and outline chapters 1-5.<br>
                  Each chapter outline should be three to five pages in length ( both front and back)</p>
                <p>Please take your time through the summer and complete this work.  DO NOT LEAVE THIS WORK UNTIL THE LAST PART OF SUMMER. It takes time and if you leave it until the end you are less likely to do well on the quizzes.   Contact me if you have any questions or want to introduce yourself.   You can find my email address through the school website.  Again thank you for taking the class and enjoy your summer.  </p>
                <p>Mrs. Wolloch</p>
