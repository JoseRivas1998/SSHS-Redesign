                We have three core "Schools," including
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Academics</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Arts</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Visual &amp; Performing Arts</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These are further broken down into areas of Academy and Emphasis, such as Law, Musical Theater, and
                    our newest emphasis S.T.E.M. These emphases areas offer prestigious certificates to further our
                    students' success after high school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If after a thoughtful discussion, you and your child decide that Santa Susana High School is a good
